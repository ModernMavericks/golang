# Best-effort: run the STAGED amd64 toolchain under emulation as a pre-publish sanity
# gate -- does the cross-produced amd64 `go` actually execute, compile, link, and run
# a program? Skips cleanly (exit 0) when amd64 execution is unavailable; must NEVER
# fail the build. Uses a pure-Go program (CGO_ENABLED=0): the staged go.env bakes the
# ABSOLUTE install CC path (/usr/local/go126/bin/mavericks-clang) + shim, which only
# exist once installed, so cgo is validated by the on-box 10.9 smoke, not here. The
# authoritative runtime gate is the real 10.9 box.
